# Howdy and Welcome! ðŸ¤ 

We are Chase and Emma, a couple of self-taught technologists who successfully transitioned into the tech industry without getting a formal degree. Neither of us came from technical backgrounds, but we were able to leverage various learning resources to build our skills and land roles in the tech industry. We are passionate about helping others achieve their goals and break into the tech industry, which is why we have curated this collection of learning paths utilizing free online resources for anyone who is interested in learning about technology! ðŸš€
